# Ambulance-GIS-System
## Simulation of a real time system to find the best path to reach its destination.

The main objective of this simulation is to demonstrate how the emergency vehicle can be guided to take the best path to reach its destination based upon the distance and the traffic congestions at the junction.

## Required packages
python 3.7 or greater

## Installation:
### Python packages:
1. SimPy for discrete-event simulation<br/>
    ```pip install simpy==4.0.1```
    
2. SymPy for solving equations <br/> ```pip install sympy==1.6.2```

3. Matplotlib for visualization <br/> ```pip install matplotlib==3.3.1```
4. NetworkX for graphical representation <br/> ```pip install networkx==2.5```
5. pandas for data structures <br/> ```pip install pandas==1.1.1```

Or all these packages can be directly installed using the requiremnts.txt using command ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Running
* Go to project directory
* Run simulation using python <br/> ```python ui.py```
